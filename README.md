# Moonjam-2017
Moonjam 2017 at IUPUI hosted by SIGGRAPH and Game Developer's group, using merge vr and the accompanying holocube attachment.
We'll be porting the comic found here https://www.dropbox.com/s/0bykml17c2erdvi/AHASVAKSILVER.pdf?dl=0

Currently the idea is to have some panels or something displayed on startup, then after a few seconds a 3d model of the ghosty dude will start floating around the cube, basically prompting the user on where to go next.

Ideas to possibly add:
* minigames for each kind of creativity, speaking, doing, and thinking
